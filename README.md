# Isometric_Pathfinding_with_AStar

This project is about implementing various pathfinding algorithms in an isometric Unity environment accounting terrain costs.

The following algorithms are used:
* breadth first search
* Dijkstra
* greedy best first
* A*

The terrain costs system is rudimentary but accounted by the A* and Dijkstra algorithms.
The tiles are Grass (cost: 1), Sand (cost: 2), Water (cost: 3) and Impassable (cost: -).
